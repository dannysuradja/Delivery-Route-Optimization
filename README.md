Attempting to optimize delivery route as a travelling salesmen problem. In this project, we utilized 200 addresses in Orange County to mimic a deliveryman delivery target in one day. Methods attempted to solve the problem are nearest neighbor method, A* search method, and simulated annealing with the use of Google Distance Matrix API. Benchmarks used are blind random search using 10,000 samples and Google's OR-Tools for Travelling Salesmen Problem [Google's Travelling Salesmen ](https://developers.google.com/optimization/routing/tsp)
